    <h2>What is Fall Guys?</h2>
      <p>Fall Guys is a free, cross-platform, massively multiplayer, party royale game where you and your fellow contestants compete through escalating rounds of absurd obstacle course chaos until one lucky victor remains!</p>
      <p>You’re invited to dive and dodge your way to victory in the pantheon of clumsy. Rookie or pro? Solo or partied up? Fall Guys delivers ever-evolving, high-concentrated hilarity and fun. The only thing more important than winning is looking as ridiculous as possible while doing it. Grab the silliest costume you can and fall in line—the show's about to start!</p>
      <p>Competitive & Cooperative: Tumble between competitive free-for-alls and cooperative challenges—or take on the Blunderdome with up to 3 friends!</p>
      <p>Play with Friends: Fall Guys supports cross-play, cross-platform parties and cross-progression via your Epic Games Account.</p>
      <p>Ever-Evolving Content: Play stays fresh with Limited Time Events and new game modes. Each Season brings with it new costumes, collabs, obstacles and ways to play.</p>
      <p>Gloriously Customizable: Choose from a multitude of Colors, Patterns, Costumes and Nameplates.</p>
